GibsonAI is built on a modern, scalable infrastructure designed to support dynamic database engineering

## Cloud-Native Architecture

GibsonAI runs on a robust cloud platform to ensure high availability and security. 

## Modular Microservices

Each component (ERD generation, schema management, API deployment) is handled by specialized microservices. This makes everything faster and easier to manage or improve.

## Containerization

Utilizes Docker and Kubernetes for easy scaling and reliable deployments.

## Data Security

GibsonAI takes your data seriously. It uses strong encryption to make sure no one can read your data without permission. It also controls who can access what, so only the right people can see or change things.

## Continuous Monitoring

Real-time monitoring and logging using smart monitoring tools. These tools track how well everything is working and alert the team if something goes wrong. This helps fix problems fast and keep the service running smoothly.
