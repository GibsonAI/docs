## Create a database from any source

Convert a hand-drawn diagram, an image of a table, a messy Google Sheet, a SQL schema, or just a JSON file into a production-ready relational database instantly. It automatically generates the schema, creates relationships, sets up validation rules, and deploys a secure, scalable API for you. This is ideal for developers, analysts, or product teams who want to turn raw structure into a working backend without writing code.

## Deploy databases using AI Agents

Use AI agent frameworks like [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), [Agno](https://www.agno.com/), or [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable//index.html) to programmatically create and manage your database workflows through GibsonAI. This setup is ideal for teams building LLM-powered dev tools or autonomous workflows where agents act as backend engineers—deploying and evolving databases without manual intervention.

## Build full-stack apps with AI IDEs

With GibsonAI, you can give natural language instructions to AI agents and have them design, deploy, and update your databases automatically. For example, just say "Create a project and add a user table with name, email, and password fields," and GibsonAI will handle everything—from schema creation to cloud deployment, ERD generation, and API publishing. It’s perfect for developers using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Bolt](https://bolt.new/) or other prompt-based IDEs who want to manage their databases by talking to their tools.

## Turn any database into apps

GibsonAI makes it easy to connect your database to popular low-code tools like [Retool](https://retool.com/) or [Bubble](https://bubble.io/). With auto-generated instant APIs and full schema access, you can build internal dashboards, admin panels, or customer portals powered by your own structured data.

## Manage database environments and clone setups across teams

GibsonAI helps teams manage multiple environments like development, staging, and production with ease. You can create isolated environments, clone entire setups for testing or collaboration, and share schemas via simple URLs. This is especially useful for teams working on microservices or multiple branches of a product that need consistent database copies with different data states.

## Migrate and modernize legacy databases with AI

You can import an old SQL dump or connect GibsonAI to your existing MySQL database, and it will reverse-engineer your schema into editable models and deployable components. This includes AI features like generating models, APIs, and ERDs for legacy databases, making modernization effortless. It’s ideal for companies migrating off outdated systems or consolidating data across services.
