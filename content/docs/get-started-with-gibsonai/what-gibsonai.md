We’re building the future of developer productivity through prompt-based database schema design, instant serverless database deployment of your choice, and ready-to-use REST APIs to manage data.

Whether you're a backend engineer, fullstack developer, or AI builder, GibsonAI removes the friction of setting up and managing databases, writing boilerplate code, and exposing APIs. Instead of creating schemas, writing migrations, and setting up CRUD endpoints manually, you just describe what you want — and Gibson does the rest.

## Every App Needs a Database — It’s Time to Simplify It

Working with databases is often repetitive work and slows developers down. The issues we developers always face are the following during the setup of a database from scratch:

### You start with a manual schema setup

You have to create tables, think through relationships, indexes, data types, and naming. You map tables to objects using ORM libraries and build APIs to access that data. It’s easy to miss things or over-complicate at an early stage.

### Schema changes are painful

Your app evolves. You rename a column, split a table, or add a new relation. Now you need to write migrations. Update your ORM. Avoid downtime. And hope nothing breaks in staging or production.

### Every change triggers more boilerplate

Once the schema changes, you usually:

- Update model files
- Fix serializers or DTOs
- Rewrite REST API endpoints or GraphQL resolvers
- Modify test data and fixtures

That’s a lot of work for just one change.

### Team coordination becomes tricky

In team projects, syncing schema changes between developers often leads to merge conflicts, broken migrations, or inconsistent environments.

## What GibsonAI Delivers?

When you describe your data model or use case (e.g., “a travel agency app with users, destinations, and bookings”), GibsonAI generates everything you need to go from idea to API.

### 1. Hosted Serverless Database

GibsonAI provisions a fully managed serverless database (PostgreSQL or MySQL), deployed to production or development environments.

- Available instantly
- Compatible with serverless apps, hosted frontends, or local testing
- The Autoscaling feature dynamically adjusts the amount of compute and storage resources in response to the current load, eliminating the need for manual intervention or restarts.

Leave the database administrative, maintenance, and scaling burdens to us.

### 2. Hosted Data API with Docs

GibsonAI auto-generates RESTful CRUD APIs based on your schema — ready to use in your frontend, mobile app, or internal tool.

- Every table in your schema has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints
- Automatic filtering, pagination, and sorting support
- Swagger-style API docs included

---

### 3. ORM Models & Validation Schemas

To help you integrate with your app backend, GibsonAI also generates:

- TypeScript or Python model definitions
- Validation schemas for form inputs or API payloads
- Code snippets to speed up integration with frameworks like Next.js, Express, FastAPI, or React

---

### 4. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Every time you generate or edit a schema, GibsonAI creates an ERD — a visual map of your database’s tables, relationships, and fields.

- Quickly understand your schema structure
- Share with your team for collaboration
- Edit directly in the visual schema designer or using natural language prompts

## Ship faster with AI tools

AI-powered tools for development and database management. GibsonAI provides several ways to integrate with AI tools and agents, from natural language database control to autonomous agent frameworks. Choose the tools that fit your workflow.

GibsonAI The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to interact with your databases using natural language, providing secure and contextual access to your data and infrastructure.
