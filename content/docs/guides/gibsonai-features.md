## AI-Powered Schema Design and Data Modeling

GibsonAI lets you create and modify database schemas using natural language. Simply describe your needs, and it generates executable SQL, Python models, and Pydantic schemas instantly from scratch or from existing schemas.

## Instant ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) Generation

As you build or change schemas, GibsonAI generates live ERDs so you can visualize table relationships and structures.

## Zero-Downtime Migrations

GibsonAI supports seamless schema migrations. You can evolve your data model in production without interruptions, updating the schema live.

## Fully Deployed APIs Out of the Box

For each new schema, GibsonAI automatically provides CRUD endpoints and comprehensive API documentation, including pagination, filtering, and sorting support.

## Native Natural Language to SQL

You can interact with your database using plain English. Ask a question and GibsonAI generates the SQL query for you to run instantly.

## Instant Provisioning of Cloud or On-Prem Databases

Deploy development and production serverless SQL instances with a single command. Instances autoscale to match your workload, only charging you for what you use.

## Autoscaling On Demand

Handling sudden traffic spikes is automatic—compute and storage adjust without intervention.

## AI-Driven Query Optimization

GibsonAI monitors query performance and offers recommendations on indexes, rewrites, or caching to improve speed.

## Connection Strings & Full Schema Export

You can retrieve production-grade connection strings and view the complete SQL schema for external use or deeper inspection.

## Support for Local Studio Tools

A dedicated "Studio" web interface (powered by Drizzle ORM) runs locally for browsing and querying your database within your browser.

## Deployment Environments and Database Cloning

GibsonAI now separates development and production environments and offers easy schema cloning via URL sharing—ideal for forking or collaborating.

## CLI-Based SQL Runner

A built-in SQL runner allows you to query databases directly from your terminal using the Gibson CLI.

## Continuous Updates to Schema Agent & Performance

Regular improvements include faster schema design, enhanced accuracy, upgraded ERD readability, and better error handling in APIs
